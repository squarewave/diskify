# diskify

Tool for viewing / modifying the physical* location of files on disk.

\* In a precise sense this is infeasible, and in another precise sense it's meaningless, but this effectively returns / allows modification of the location that the OS gives to the driver for files. Basically, this is the guts of a very rudimentary defragger.
